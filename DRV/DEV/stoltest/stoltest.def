; Dynamic link library providing inp, outp, inpw, outpw to CSET/2
;
; This definition module defines the exports available in the .DLL file
; to be created.  This is the "safe" way to use inp/outp since the code
; is physically separated, and only this DLL is given IOPL priveleges.
;
; To data, I have not figured out how to specify the SEGMENT of an
; assembly language program with alternate attributes through the
; .DEF module.  However, using "CODE IOPL", the IOPL priveleges can
; be granted to all segments.  If necessary, the privelege can be taken
; away from all other segments (not necessary here since portio.asm is
; the only module).
;
; Explanation of some statements
;
; LIBRARY PORTIO                  Name of DLL (MUST match real name)
; CODE PRELOAD EXECUTEONLY IOPL   Default IOPL in segments of class CODE
;                                 Might as well preload since it is so
;                                 small, but mark execute only.
; PROTMODE                        This is a protect mode program only
; EXPORTS                         List of names exported by the DLL
; @inp                            External name of a _Far16 _Fastcall inp()
; ...
;
; For some reason, the @ must be aligned in column 1 of this file.  Who
; understands all the subleties of the compiler/linkers?
